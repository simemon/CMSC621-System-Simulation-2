Execute compile.sh (make sure it has executable permission, otherwise run: chmod +x compile.sh)

./compile.sh

Go to output directory:

cd output/

Execute run.sh (make sure it has executable permission as well, otherwise run: chmod +x run.sh)
./run.sh


It is working fine on my system, let me know if you are not able to get the output because of unclear instructions.
